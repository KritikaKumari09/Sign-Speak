📖 Overview

Our project is a Real-Time Sign Language Communication App built to empower deaf and mute individuals by enabling them to communicate effortlessly with people who speak different languages.

Traditional communication between sign language users and non-signers often requires interpreters, text-based mediums, or prior knowledge of sign language. This app removes these barriers by combining Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies to provide an instant, accessible, and user-friendly communication channel.

🔹 The app translates sign language into spoken language and ensures two-way communication:

Deaf/mute users express themselves naturally using signs → heard as speech by listeners.

Listeners respond verbally → response is shown as text output for deaf/mute users.

⚙️ How It Works
1. Gesture Input

User performs sign language gestures in front of a camera.

The app captures these gestures in real time using the device’s camera.

2. Gesture Recognition (LSTM Model)

An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model processes the video input and recognizes gestures.

LSTM handles sequential data, making it effective for continuous sign gestures (not just isolated frames).

The model is trained on a diverse dataset of sign language gestures, ensuring high accuracy and robustness.

3. Translation & Speech (Murf API)

Recognized gesture → converted into text.

The text is passed to the Murf API, which generates natural-sounding voice output.

Voice can be generated in multiple languages, enabling cross-cultural communication.

4. Two-Way Communication

The hearing/speaking individual responds verbally.

Their response is transcribed into text and displayed on the app for the deaf/mute user.

Enables smooth, real-time, two-way interaction — no interpreter required.

🌟 Key Features

🌍 Cross-Language Communication: Supports multiple languages for inclusivity across regions & cultures.

⚡ Real-Time Detection: Instant recognition & translation with minimal delay.

🎯 High Accuracy: LSTM ensures context-aware recognition of continuous gestures.

🔊 Human-like Voice Output: Powered by Murf API for natural, realistic TTS.

🖥️ User-Friendly Interface: Simple, intuitive, and accessible design.

♿ Accessibility & Inclusivity: Bridges communication gaps in education, healthcare, workplaces, and daily life.

🔧 Customizable & Open Source: Extendable to new sign languages (ASL, ISL, BSL, etc.) and region-specific gestures.

🌍 Impact & Applications

This app has the potential to revolutionize communication for the deaf and mute community, with wide-ranging applications:

📚 Education: Seamless interaction between deaf students, teachers, and peers.

🏥 Healthcare: Patients communicate with doctors without interpreters.

💼 Workplaces: Promotes inclusivity in professional environments.

🛒 Daily Life: Interaction in shops, banks, public transport, and social settings.

By breaking down both communication and language barriers, this app fosters equality, inclusivity, and accessibility — contributing to a more connected and empathetic society.

🏁 Conclusion

The Real-Time Sign Language Communication App is more than a technological innovation — it’s a social impact project.

By combining AI-driven gesture recognition with multi-language speech generation, it enables deaf and mute individuals to communicate naturally, inclusively, and globally.

✨ With real-time, high-accuracy, and user-friendly features, it’s a powerful step toward a world where communication knows no barriers.
