SignSpeak
Our project, SignSpeak, is a Real-Time Sign Language Communication App built to empower deaf and mute individuals by enabling them to communicate effortlessly with people who do not use sign language. Traditional communication often requires interpreters, text-based mediums, or prior knowledge of signs. SignSpeak removes these barriers by combining Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Murf API's Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology to provide an instant, accessible, and user-friendly communication channel.

üîπ The App's Mission
SignSpeak translates sign language into spoken language:

Deaf/mute users express themselves naturally using signs ‚Üí heard as speech by listeners.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Gesture Input
The user performs sign language gestures in front of a camera. The app captures these gestures in real time using the device‚Äôs camera.

Gesture Recognition (LSTM Model)
An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model processes the video input and recognizes the gestures. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of sign language gestures, ensuring high accuracy and robustness for continuous sign gestures.

Translation & Speech (Murf API)
The recognized gesture is converted into text. This text is then passed to the Murf API, which generates natural-sounding voice output. The voice can be generated in multiple languages, enabling cross-cultural communication.

One-Way Communication
The app provides a real-time, one-way communication channel from sign language to spoken language.

üåü Key Features
Cross-Language Communication: Supports multiple languages for inclusivity across regions and cultures.

Real-Time Detection: Instant recognition and translation with minimal delay.

High Accuracy: The LSTM model ensures context-aware recognition of continuous gestures.

Human-like Voice Output: Powered by Murf API for natural, realistic TTS.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple, intuitive, and accessible design.

Accessibility & Inclusivity: Bridges communication gaps in education, healthcare, workplaces, and daily life.

Customizable & Open Source: The model is extendable to new sign languages (ASL, ISL, BSL, etc.) and region-specific gestures.

üåç Impact & Applications
SignSpeak is more than a technological innovation; it's a social impact project. By breaking down both communication and language barriers, it fosters equality, inclusivity, and accessibility, contributing to a more connected and empathetic society.

Education: Facilitates seamless interaction between deaf students, teachers, and peers.

Healthcare: Enables patients to communicate with doctors without an interpreter.

Workplaces: Promotes inclusivity and collaboration in professional environments.

Daily Life: Simplifies interactions in shops, banks, public transport, and social settings.

üèÅ Conclusion
SignSpeak is a powerful step toward a world where communication knows no barriers. With its real-time, high-accuracy, and user-friendly features, it enables deaf and mute individuals to communicate naturally, inclusively, and globally.
